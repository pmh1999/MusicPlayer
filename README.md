- [x]  There is a progress bar that shows the currently playing song, along with the song title, artist name, and album art.
- [x]  There are play, pause and stop buttons to control.
- [x]  There is a search bar to filter songs by title or artist name.
- [x]  Play music in the background so that it continues to play even when the screen is off or another application is open.
